maven is a software project management and comprehension tool

maven vs ant
	ant is basically an outdated competitor

maven generates directories

POM is maven's guidelines

groupId
	organization
	convention is using reverse domain name
	.cc.multivision.demo

artifactId
	a unique identifier for groupId

packaging 

new -> other -> maven project

Primary key
condidate key chosen to ID each row
notnull, unique
should never change

- natural key - batyrakkt icy=cyrrubg bit bykk ybuqye & fairly stable field
- surrogate key - auto generated
- foreign key - a column reference to another column or set of columns, can have a reference to null

CONSTRAINTS
Primary key
Foreign key
Unique id
Not null
CHECK
DEFAULT

referential integrity - 
	property that describes the state of relationships in database. All of our foreign key relationships must be maintained

domain integrity - 
	ensuring that all data is of the correct type, size

one to many 1:N
one to one 1:1
many to many N:N

"junction table"
student_courses
S_ID	C_ID	TIME
1	5	MWF	<<
1	10	TR	
1	11		
2	5		
2	6		
composite key - key made of >1 column 


"look up tables"
ACC_TYPE
TypeID	TYPE
1	Check
2	Savings
3	LongTerm
look up for static values
can change the type without messing up referential integrity

Database Normalization
process of organizing database to increase efficiency and reduce redundancy

1NF the key - 	tables must have primary key
		no repeated columns
		atomic data (smaller relevant data) ex name column is first/last name
2NF the whole key - 	1NF
			cannot have partial dependencies
3NF nothing but the key -	2NF
				cannot have transitive dependencies
				can only deduce this information from primary key
