    THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING CALLED COLUMN COMBINATOR USED FOR HTML TABLES...

    THERE'S VARIOUS REASONS WHICH YOU CAN READ HERE: 
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/83073/why-not-use-tables-for-layout-in-html

    LET'S GET INTO SOMETHING MORE USEFUL! PSEUDO-CLASSES!

    PSEUDO-CLASSES SELECTS ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR STATES, WHICH IS INFORMATION
    NOT CONTAINED IN THE DOCUMENT TREE (SEE HTML DOM FOR MORE INFO). 

    THERE'S TOO MANY PSEUDOCLASSES TO GO OVER, SO LET'S GO OVER THE MOST USEFUL ONES...
    *******************************************************************************/

/*
    NTH-CHILD PSEUDOCLASS:
    WITHIN THE PARANTHESIS, IT TAKES IN A SINGLE ARGUMENT.
    IT CAN TAKE IN A KEYWORD VALUE "EVEN" OR "ODD"
    OR IT CAN TAKE A FUNCTIONAL NOTATION IN THE FORM OF <AN+B>

    THE FUNCTIONAL NOTATION CAN BE READ AS:
    SELECT EVERY A'TH ELEMENT STARTING WITH B.

    IN THE EXAMPLE BELOW, THE FUNCTIONAL NOTATION CAN BE READ AS:
    SELECT EVERY 2ND ELEMENT STARTING WITH 5.

    WORTH NOTING THERE IS A FIRST-CHILD AND LAST-CHILD PSEUDOCLASS,
    BUT THIS PARTICULAR PSEUDOCLASS IS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO REPLACE BOTH.
