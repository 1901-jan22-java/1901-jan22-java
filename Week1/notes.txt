ALWAYS USE THE INTERFACE AS THE REFERENCE TYPE

linked lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored in contiguous (next to each other) locations. and every element is a seperate object with a link to it's successor
each element is known as a node.

markup interface is an interface with no methods or fields

serialize means you convert a string into strings of bytes

markup interface tells the entity can be turned into bytes

functional interface is the only method used in a markup interface
