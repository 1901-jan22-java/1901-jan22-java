Collections 3 things. all interfaces
-queue

-list

-sets
	->sortedset

	dont allow for duplicates


Maps are key value pairs. not associated with collections but are similar.



ArrayList
List list = new ArrayList();
^^^^

ALWAYS USE THE INTERFACE AS THE REFERENCE TYPE

linked lists are linear data structures where elements are not stored in contiguous (next to each other) locations. and every element is a seperate object with a link to it's successor
each element is known as a node.

markup interface is an interface with no methods or fields

serialize means you convert a string into strings of bytes

markup interface tells the entity can be turned into bytes

functional interface is the only method used in a markup interface

as we get better, there's less need to test. but should always do unit testing
this is done with junit
jar is a file type
jars let us import java.utils
add dependencies

Spring, Hibernate all compatible with Java, but not written in java. 
reason for this is because there are files that let you run them known as jars, JUnit
-> unit testing framework
-> assert class's methods
-> annotations
	@before, @after, @beforeclass, @afterclass, @test, @runwith, @suiteclasses

maven - build tool
lets you run mvn


Reflection - how java does introspection on classes
log4J - logging framework
