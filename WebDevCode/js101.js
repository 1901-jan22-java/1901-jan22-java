/*
JavaScript is a scripting language used for client side operations. 
Do Note, however, that there are many frameworks that allow the server -side use of JS. It's known as a client side language because it can be interpreted from the browser

-loosely typed - we do not delcare variable types
they are dynamically allocated base on the assignment of the variable. We delcare variable with one of the
three keywords
-let - allows for block scope
-var - does not distinguish between block and function scope
-const does not allow vars to be reassigned
-var scopes
-global -accessible throughout the entirety of the script and through the console in the browser. Globally scoped variables are delcared outside of any function of block OR they have
just never been delcared and their declaration is hoisted to the top of the page, making them global
-function
-block - only with the use of let or const
-datatypes include number, string, boolean, objects,
undefined, NaN (debatable bc typeof(NaN) = number)
-if..else, returns, switch, try..catch, do..while, for, breaks, continue, while
- TRUTHY and FALSY
-because JS is loosely typed, we have to be able to assign everything a true or false identity so that they can be 
evaluated as conditions in control statement
-falsy - false, null, 0, undefined, NaN, ""
-truthy - everything else
-Type coersion - the process that JS takes to bring data from one type to another to compare the actual value as oppose to the datatype
