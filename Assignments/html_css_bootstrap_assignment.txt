Create a styled HTML page detailing any topic that we've covered over the first three weeks of training. 
There is no formal due date, but complete this by 2/11, as there will be random presentations of these sites throughout Week 4.
Technologies to use: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (optional JS but not mandatory; a static page is fine)
Use at least 8 different types of tags in the body tags. 
Get creative!
