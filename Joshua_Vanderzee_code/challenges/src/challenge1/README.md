Challenge 1 is to see if the sum of 2 values in an array equals the target value.

In this challenge, I will use my EvenNumberClass from the assignment to speed up the search by checking if the number is odd or even. Then I will have it then check the array and see if it is possible by making sure I have the ability to reach it. after that I can do 2 foreach loops and add the to numbers.
