/*
JavaScript is a scripting language used for client side operations

Do note, however, that there are mahy frameworks that allow the server-side
use of JS. It's known as a client-side language because it can be interpreted from
the browse

- loosely typed - we can not declare variable types, they are dynamically allocated 
based on the assignment of the variable. We declare variables with one of the three keywords
    - let - allows for block scope
    - var - does not distinguish between block and function scope
    - const - does not allow vars to be reassigned
- var scopes
    - global - accesible throughout the entirety of the script
    and through the consol in the browser. Globally scoped variables are declared
    and their declaration is "hoisted" to the tope of the page, making them global
    - function
    - block - only with use of let or const

- datatypes include number, string, boolean, objects, undefined,
    NaN (debatable bc typeOf(NaN) = number)
- if..else, returns, swithc, try...cathc, do..while, for, breaks, continue, while
-TRUTHY AND FALSY
    - because JS is loosely typed,
