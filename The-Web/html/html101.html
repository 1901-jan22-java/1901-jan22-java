    This is a comment!
    HTML - HyperText Markup Language is the standard language 
    for structuring web pages
    It is a series of elements represented by tags, their attributes, 
    and their contents. 

    For every HTML page, there must be a descriptor of what kind of 
    document it is for the browser to propertly interpret it 
    HTML 5 rids itself of the long doctype description and simply 
    uses <!DOCTYPE html> to signify what it is 
-->
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- This is where any metadata goes. We can also bring in 
    external files (js, css, etc) inside of the head tag 
    Only two things in this tag will be explicitly seen on your
    page:
    The title is the text displayed on your tab, and the optional
    icon is the image displayed-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>HTML 101</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content to be seen goes here!-->
    
    <h1>About HTML (h1)</h1>
    <h2 id="second">About HTML (h2)</h2>
